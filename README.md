- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mclenx
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full stack developper
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to operate Github, and how to make basics websites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of things, though currently, I am doubtful I can be of much help.
- 📫 How to reach me: through GitHub or from my e-mail.
